I recently wanted to integrate a SQL Server database with a Python application. I found that the best way to do this was to use the pyodbc library. This library allows you to connect to a SQL Server database and execute queries. In this article, I will show you how to connect to a SQL Server database using the pyodbc library.

Sadly, this is a less explored topic and I had to experiment on my own and find the best solution for me.

## How to Run:
Clone the repository and run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up
```

The SQL Server Time will be displayed in the console.

you can then plug in your Django app and connect to the SQL Server database.
